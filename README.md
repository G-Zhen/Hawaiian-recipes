# Hawaiian-recipes
TOP project: Recipe website

Goals:
1. Build a simple HTML site with images and links
2. Figure out basics of Git and Github

Complications during project:
* Finished making the site but had complications in uploading to GitHub. I had to spend an extra day to figure out the directories and complications. 
* Created and deleted my GitHub repo 3 times before figureing it out.

Project Reflections:
* The hard part was not creating the site. That took me about half an hour with no complications or confusions. 
* The difficulties lie in using Git and GitHub. That added lots of extra steps in programming. 

1. With each change (creating new files, modifying code, etc) do [git add .]
2. Record your change with a message in [git commit -m "some description" -m "more description"]
3. Check everything is ok with [git status]
4. Upload to GitHub when you are done [git push origin main]
